Please use these guidelines to do a self-review of the document, before you send the document for Peer review or PDF check.
This page contains the common list of items that we check for during Style Guide compliance as part of peer review and PDF check, but is not exhaustive.
  Style Guide compliance: 
Close list entries that are complete sentences with a period. List entries that are single words do not require closing punctuation such as periods, semicolons, or commas.
Make sure that references of Content Server are replaced by Documentum Server or OpenText Content Server.
Use OpenText as a single word instead of Open Text in the content you author.  Open Text should be used only as part of the legal notice.
Use 'later' instead of 'higher' when referring to “xxx version or/and later”.
Use 'earlier' instead of 'lower' when referring to “xxx version or/and earlier”.
Use 'following' instead of 'below' when referring to “in the following screenshot”.
Use 'preceding' instead of 'above' when referring to an object or text preceding the current text.
Do not use “please” in the document.
Make sure that OT and third-party product names in running text have correct capitalization, such as SharePoint, JBoss, PostgreSQL, Docker, Helm, and so on. Refer to the third-party website to obtain the correct product name.
Do not prefix a cross reference with the article “the”. For example: “For more information, see <cross-reference>.”
Add a colon at the end of a lead-in sentence that introduces a list, procedure, table, image, and so on.
Make sure that the introductory sentence refers to the correct element of the document, such as section or chapter or appendix.
This error is usually seen after restructuring a document.
Make sure that when you refer to a file extension, it is specified in uppercase. For example: PDF, JAR, ZIP, TAR, WAR, and so on.
This is not applicable if the extension is part of the filename. For example: signature.pdf, contentsvr.war, and so on.
Make sure that you use the term “on-premises” instead of on-prem, onprem, On-prem, on-premise, and so on.
Make sure that all chapter, section, subsection, procedure,  column headings, and so on are in sentence case. See Style Guide for more details.
Make sure that the correct version numbers are used.
Make sure that EOL products are removed or updated accordingly from the documentation. For example, references to Internet Explorer.
Apply the guilabel tag to UI elements instead of emphasis or highlight tags.
Avoid the use of brackets in running text.
Prefix titles of Guides and Release Notes with 'OpenText'.
Make sure that you provide cross references to steps in a procedure. The step number can become incorrect, if a step is introduced or removed in the procedure.
Make sure that you do not use docbase and docbroker in running text, instead use repository and connection broker respectively.
Make sure that you do not use words like etc, i.e., and via. Use “and so on”, “that is”, and “using” respectively.

  PDF Check:  
Fix page layout inconsistencies and any glaring errors while viewing the PDF in a two-page view Page Display mode. Examples: 
- Overlapping text or graphics 
- Text or graphics exceeding page margin
Eliminate mini TOCs in chapters.

Fix broken cross-references.

Fix extra spaces in the TOCs - in the section/chapter titles.

Fix itemized lists, ordered lists, or procedures that are broken into multiple lists and ensure the sequence is correct. 
If there are notes or graphics in a list item, the consecutive list items are added as a new list.

Make sure that images are legible and clear. Replace blurry images with new images from engineering or delete the image.

Make sure that tables are migrated correctly from the older source files. We have seen cells that are not merged, content in the wrong columns, and so on.

Make sure that there are spaces before or after text that is in a different format.
We have seen that the leading or trailing spaces within an xml tag in the source file is not rendered in the output.

Make sure that table headers are set to header row in the source file and are not boldface.

Avoid itemizing a single item.
