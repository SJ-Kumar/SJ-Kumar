# Introduction

Greetings and a warm welcome to my research docs website! Here, you will have access to my meticulously crafted research documents,
all of which are freely available under the [AGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license. I am thrilled to share my work with you,
and I encourage you to explore my research and use it as a reference for your own studies.! You can view my research and use it for your research if need be.
I hope you enjoy my research and find it useful!

## How did I make this ?

I used to a framework called [Nextra](https://nextra.site). A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** site generation framework with everything you love from Next.js.
