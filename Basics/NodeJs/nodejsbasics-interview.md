#### 1. How does the NodeJS application use the CPU cores and threads to execute the code?

Node.js is a single-threaded event-driven runtime environment.
It uses a single thread, known as the event loop, to handle requests and execute JavaScript code.
The event loop allows Node.js to handle concurrent connections without creating additional threads.
The built-in "cluster" module enables distribution of the workload across child processes.
Child processes run on different CPU cores and handle requests independently.
Each child process still operates on a single thread, utilizing the event loop.
The cluster module allows scaling of Node.js applications across multiple CPU cores, enhancing performance and handling more concurrent requests.
Node.js also offers the optional "worker_threads" module for creating and managing additional JavaScript threads.
Worker threads are useful for CPU-intensive tasks and parallel processing.
Utilizing the cluster module or worker threads allows efficient utilization of available hardware resources.

Refer the code - **server-multicore.js** pgm to understand the above concept better.


#### 2. Can a multi-core virtual machine increase the performance of the NodeJS backend web app?
Yes, a multi-core virtual machine can enhance the performance of a Node.js backend web app.
By utilizing the available CPU cores, you can distribute the workload and enable parallel processing.
This improves response times, throughput, and the ability to handle concurrent requests.
The performance boost depends on factors like workload, code efficiency, and infrastructure scalability.
Consider resource requirements and limitations of the virtual machine hosting the Node.js app.

In summary, a multi-core virtual machine can potentially boost performance by distributing the workload and enabling parallel processing in a Node.js backend web application.

#### 3. NodeJS is single-threaded following an Event Loop model, but then how can we execute CPU-intensive tasks in NodeJS without blocking off our web server?

To execute CPU-intensive tasks in Node.js without blocking the web server, you can:

Utilize the "worker_threads" module in Node.js.
Create additional JavaScript threads within the Node.js application.
Worker threads allow parallel processing of CPU-intensive tasks.
They run independently of the main event loop, preventing blocking.
By distributing tasks to worker threads, the web server remains responsive.
Worker threads can handle calculations, data processing, or other intensive operations.
This approach improves overall performance and scalability of the Node.js application.

In summary, Node.js provides the "worker_threads" module for executing CPU-intensive tasks in parallel without blocking the web server. By utilizing worker threads, you can offload intensive operations and maintain the responsiveness of your Node.js application.
