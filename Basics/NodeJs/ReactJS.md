### What is React.js?	
React.js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render those components when the underlying data changes. React follows a declarative approach, making it easier to build complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, reusable components.

### What are the key features of React.js?	
The key features of React.js include:<br>
- Virtual DOM for efficient UI rendering<br>
- Component-based architecture for reusability<br>
- One-way data flow with a unidirectional data flow pattern<br>
- JSX syntax for writing components<br>
- React hooks for managing state and lifecycle<br>
- Efficient reconciliation algorithm for optimized rendering<br>
- Strong community support and ecosystem of libraries and tools

### What is JSX in React.js?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension in React.js that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. 
It provides a concise and familiar way to describe the structure and appearance of UI components. 
JSX is transpiled into regular JavaScript function calls, which are then executed by React to render components. 
Here's an example:<br>
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

### What is the difference between React components and elements?	
React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate the UI logic and can be 
composed together to create complex UIs. 
React elements, on the other hand, are plain JavaScript objects that represent the components, their properties, and children. 
Elements are the output of component rendering and can be thought of as the description of what should be displayed on the screen.

### What is the difference between functional and class components in React?	
Functional components are JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements to describe the UI. 
They are simpler and easier to read and write. Class components, on the other hand, are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. 
They have additional features like state and lifecycle methods. 
However, with the introduction of React hooks, functional components can also manage state and lifecycle, reducing the need for class components in many cases.

### What are React hooks?	
React hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow functional components to have state, lifecycle methods, and other React features without 
using class components. Hooks provide a more concise and intuitive way to write components by allowing the reuse of stateful logic. 
Some commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer. 
Here's an example using the useState hook:<br>

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

### How do you handle forms in React?	
In React, form handling involves capturing and managing user input from HTML form elements. 
You can store form input in component state using controlled components, where the form elements' values are controlled by React. 
You can then handle form submission and validation using JavaScript functions. 
Here's an example of a simple form handling in React:<br>

function MyForm() 

{ 
const [name, setName] = useState(''); 
const handleSubmit = (e) => { e.preventDefault(); 
console.log(name); }; 
return ( <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> <input type="text" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
