## Changes to be done for CLOUD machines

In cloud, to make LSCS calls from LSDS(runtime), we need to do following changes:

1. Disable probes by running following commands from /opt/workspace
	> ./toggle_disableProbes.should
	> ./toggle_
	keepAlive.sh
2. Go to the LSDS pod and open the "content.properties" file in the following location.

   /Interwoven/LiveSiteDisplayServices/runtime/web/WEB-INF/conf/livesite_customer/content.properties
   
3. Update the "external.lscs.host" property in that file with LSCS host name (Ex: https://lscs.public.teamsite.info)
4. Restart the tomcat by running following command from /opt/tomcat/bin
	> ./catalina.sh stop
	> ./catalina.sh start
	
5. Now go to LSCS pod and enable CORS in the "lscs-conf.properties" file.

   /Interwoven/LiveSiteCSRT/runtime/webapps/lscs/WEB-INF/classes/lscs-conf.properties
   
6. Restart the tomcat by running following command from /opt/tomcat/bin
	> ./catalina.sh stop
	> ./catalina.sh start
