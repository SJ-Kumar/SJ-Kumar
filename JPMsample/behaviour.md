## Conflict resolution 
#### New Grad

During college, I was working on a software development project with a diverse team for our capstone course. 
I found myself in a disagreement with a teammate about the best way to implement a specific feature in our application. 
We had contrasting ideas about the technology stack to use, and it became apparent that we needed to resolve this issue in order to move forward as a team.

I made a conscious effort to actively listen to my teammate's concerns, putting my own opinions aside for a moment. 
By doing so, I gained a better understanding of their rationale for preferring a certain technology, and we were able to identify some common ground. 
Together, we discussed potential solutions, weighing the pros and cons of each approach, while considering factors like performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Ultimately, we reached a compromise that satisfied both parties, allowing us to proceed with the project in a collaborative and efficient manner. 
This experience taught me the value of active listening, empathy, and finding common ground in resolving conflicts. 
I also learned that open communication and collaboration are essential for a team's success, especially when working on complex software projects, and these skills have continued to serve me well in my professional endeavors.


## Navigating Ambiguity

During my internship at Zillow I was assigned to a team working on a new feature for the company's rental product. The project requirements were still evolving, and there was a lot of ambiguity around what the final implementation should look like.

Faced with this uncertainty, I decided to take a proactive approach. I started by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and identifying the dependencies between them. 
This allowed me to work on aspects of the project that were less ambiguous while waiting for clarity on other parts.

When I encountered roadblocks or needed guidance, I wasn't afraid to ask questions and seek help from my teammates and manager. 
I also attended relevant meetings and discussions, which provided valuable insights into the project's direction and helped me stay informed about any changes.

By remaining adaptable and resourceful throughout the project, I was able to contribute meaningfully to the development of the new feature, despite the ambiguity surrounding its requirements. 
This experience taught me the importance of being proactive, adaptable, and willing to seek guidance.


## Driving Results
When I was an intern at Uber, I was given the responsibility of implementing a new feature for their mobile app. Despite being new to the team and the technology, I was determined to drive results and make a meaningful impact during my internship.

To achieve this, I actively sought guidance from my teammates, learned the necessary programming languages, and set realistic goals for myself. 
By breaking down the project into smaller tasks and diligently tracking my progress, I managed to complete the feature ahead of schedule, earning recognition from my team and contributing to the app's overall success.

The key here was my proactivity. I went out of my way to learn the technology stack and familiarize myself with the product through documentation and by asking questions. 
This enabled me to deliver the feature expeditiously.

## Growing Continuously 

During my time as a student, I was passionate about continuously improving my programming skills and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. 
I took advantage of online resources like coding tutorials, blog posts, and webinars to learn new programming languages and frameworks.

One summer, I decided to challenge myself by participating in a local hackathon. This event pushed me out of my comfort zone, as I had to quickly adapt to new technologies and collaborate with team members to build a functional prototype within a tight deadline. 
Through this experience, I learned the importance of effective time management, teamwork, and embracing challenges as opportunities for growth.

Since then, I have continued to seek out opportunities for personal development, including attending industry conferences and joining local coding meetups. These experiences have not only expanded my technical skills but also helped me build a strong professional network and gain valuable insights into the tech industry.
