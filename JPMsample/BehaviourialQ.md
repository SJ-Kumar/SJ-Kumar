# Tell me about a time when you faced a conflict with a team member and how you resolved it ?
During a group project in my sophomore year, I had a disagreement with a team member over the design approach for our application. We had differing opinions on the best approach to take. To resolve the conflict, I initiated a one-on-one conversation with the team member to understand their perspective and shared my own views. We actively listened to each other, respected each other's opinions, and found a middle ground that combined our ideas. We then communicated our agreed-upon approach to the rest of the team, and the project proceeded smoothly with a successful outcome.


# Tell me about a time when you positively impacted a project.

During a hackathon event, I was part of a team developing a web application. I identified that the user interface (UI) of the application was not intuitive and could impact the user experience. To address this, I conducted user feedback sessions, collected feedback on the UI, and identified key areas of improvement. I then worked closely with the UI/UX team and incorporated the feedback to redesign the UI, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.


 # Tell me about a scenario when a project didn't go according to your plan, and what you did to get it back on track?
## Example Answer 1:
During my internship, I was leading a team in developing a mobile app for a client. We encountered unexpected technical issues during the development phase, which caused delays in the project timeline. To get the project back on track, I took the following steps:

- Conducted a root cause analysis: I worked closely with the team to identify the root causes of the technical issues, conducted thorough debugging and testing, and consulted with senior developers and experts to gain insights.
- Developed a mitigation plan: Based on the root cause analysis, I developed a mitigation plan that included specific steps to address the technical issues, reallocated resources, and revised the project timeline accordingly.
- Communicated proactively: I communicated the issues, the mitigation plan, and the revised timeline to the team, the client, and other stakeholders in a transparent and proactive manner. I ensured everyone was aware of the changes and their roles in the revised plan.
- Monitored progress and made adjustments: I closely monitored the progress of the mitigation plan, tracked key milestones, and made adjustments as needed to ensure the project was on track. I also maintained open communication channels with the team, encouraged collaboration, and provided support and guidance as required.
As a result of these actions, we were able to overcome the technical challenges, get the project back on track, and deliver it successfully to the client within the revised timeline
