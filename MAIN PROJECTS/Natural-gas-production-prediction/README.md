# **India. (IND) Dry Natural Gas Production Prediction - Machine Learning**
Dry Natural Gas Production of the India
I made the prediction based on machine learning principles.
This software I have implemented using the Python coding language
It consists of 3 main module files. In addition to this software, data logs are kept.

1) Accuracy analysis of software and data.
2) Software machine learning polynomial graph.
3) Predict of Dry Natural Gas expected to be produced in the coming years.

###**The coding language used:**

`Python 3.9.6`

###**Libraries Used:**

`Sklearn`

`Matplotlib`

`Numpy`

`
Logging`
### **Developer Information:**
