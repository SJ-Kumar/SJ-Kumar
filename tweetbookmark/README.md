# Twitter Filter

Sometimes when I see a intresting twitter account I want to know
what their followers liked or retweeted the most.

Twitter allows to use [advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) to
find tweets with minimum retweets or likes.

I made a simple bookmarklet, or a script that can be saved into browser's bookmarks bar.
When clicked on `twitter.com/...` domain, it pre-populates advanced search settings
to quickly explore the most popular content of an account.

# install

To install the script, simply go [tweetbookmark](http://SJ-Kumar.github.io/tweetbookmark) page
and drag your favorite filters into the bookmarks bar.

Next time when you are browsing twitter profile - click on the bookmark
